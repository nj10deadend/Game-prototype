        <p className='homeText'> Whether you live here or are just visiting, we hope you enjoy your experience!
            There's so much to do here with so many wonderful characters. We created an interactive game to explore the wonders of Bikini Bottom with our very own long-time resident, SpongeBob Squarepants. You may go jellyfishing, but please be careful and stay away from the stingers! For you land-walkers, in case you miss home, you can experince life above water (down below) with Sandy, the squirrel next door. For those of you who are more musically inclined, we can offer clarinet lessons with Squidward or Squillium, be sure to book lessons as soon as possible-Squillium has a waitlist already! Got the rumblies in your tumblies? The award-winning Krusty Krab is just a short walk away (please avoid the Chum Bucket, we've heard stories...). If you came to relax or catch a beautiful sunset, it's time to hit the Goo Lagoon with Larry the Lobster and soak up the sun. This is just a taste of the blissful community here at Bikini Bottom, we are very excited to meet you. Lastly, whatever you do, please watch out for chocolate guy! He's harmless, but runs at top speed shouting chocolate whilst foaming at the mouth. It may alarm you at first, but as long as you are not in his path, you'll be fine.
